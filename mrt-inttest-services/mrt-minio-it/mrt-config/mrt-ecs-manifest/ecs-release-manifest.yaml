# Merritt services have code builds associated with them that build docker images and push to ECR.
# The branch or tag name is used as a docker image tag.
# - mrt-service-repo:branch-name
# - mrt-service-repo:tag-name
#
# When specific branches or tags are built, a second tag may be assigned to the docker image
# - mrt-service-repo:stack-name
#
# For development stacks, the service may automatically redeploy after the image has been built.
#
# Deployed docker images will be rebuilt on a daily basis.
# In the case of Java based images, the code will not be rebuilt.  Only the docker file will be rebuilt.

  #   stage should map to a tag, but it could temporarily use a branch

  #   prod should always map to a tag
